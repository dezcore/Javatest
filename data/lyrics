I'll never be more loved than I am right now
Wasn't holding You up
So there's nothing I can do to let You down
It doesn't take a trophy to make You proud
I'll never be more loved than I am right now, oh
Going through a storm but I won't go down
I hear Your voice
Carried in the rhythm of the wind to call me out
You would cross an ocean so I wouldn't drown
You've never been closer than You are right now
(Let's sing it loud y'all)
You are Jireh, You are enough
Jireh, You are enough
And I will be content in every circumstance
You are Jireh, You are enough
Forever enough
Always enough
More than enough
Forever enough
Always enough
More than enough
I don't wanna forget how I feel right now
On the mountaintop
I can see so clear what it's all about
So stay by my side when the sun goes down
Don't wanna forget how I feel right now (Jireh)
Jireh, You are enough
Jireh, You are enough (so I will be)
I will be content in every circumstance
Jireh, You are enough (He is always enough)
He's forever enough
Always enough
Always more than enough
He is, He is
Forever enough
Always enough (He's everything, He's always)
More than enough (yeah)
